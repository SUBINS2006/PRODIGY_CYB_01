# Caesar Cipher – Java Implementation 🔐

This project is part of the *PRODIGY INFOTECH Cybersecurity Internship* (Task 1).  
It implements the classic *Caesar Cipher* algorithm using Java.

---

## 📌 Project Description

The *Caesar Cipher* is one of the oldest known encryption techniques.  
In this program, users can:
- Encrypt a plaintext message using a shift key
- Decrypt a ciphertext back to the original message

This console-based Java application takes user input and performs letter-based shifting.
